La imagen es un ejemplo de como quiero la tabla con la siguiente letra de las canción Unlasting de lisa, letra:"All alone, here and crying on my own
Everything builds up and spills away…

The days were bright, but for the two of us, too white 
And it's so painful to see 

If you can live all by yourself, alone 
I don't think I can love or feel anymore 

Your scent lingers around me 
Your voice keeps ringing through me, today 
And I know that our tale has ended 
But these pieces of our love are still stuck in me 


And I will keep on wishing 
Oh, I'll keep on praying now today 
That you will feel the same way, so far away 
I hope that you'll be crying… 

And each step, feels heavier with each new breath
I feel so lost and alone 

And if someday I was born again 
I wish I could just see you once so my heart could mend 

And in the summer sunshine
Or in the winter's falling snowflakes
As the days keep on rolling over
I can see the pieces of our love falling down 

Somehow I'm kind of happy 
Yet still, I'm feeling lonely without you 
Cause my love still overflows, and now I know
It's bigger than you could know 

And even though you held the key in your hands
You left this canary in silence to stand
Alone, in it's dark cage, to rot away… 


Your scent lingers around me 
Your voice keeps ringing through me, today 
And I know that our tale has ended 
But these pieces of our love are still stuck in me 

And I will keep on wishing 
Oh, I'll keep on praying, evermore 
That someday, you'll find your way, that you will smile 
I hope that you'll be happy 

Unlasting love
The course of love 
From everything, think of you…".
